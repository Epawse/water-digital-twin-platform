# Worklog for change: add-gis-drawing-toolkit

## Current Goal

**Phase 0-1, 7-14 completed (~55/89 tasks = 62%)**. Properties panel is now functional.

Next priority options:
- **Phase 2-6**: Enhance drawing tools (real-time measurements)
- **Phase 15**: Snap functionality
- **Phase 16**: Undo/Redo

---

## Key Decisions

### Architecture & Code Reuse (Phase 0)
1. **Hybrid Architecture Adopted**: Custom abstractions (BaseTool, BaseGraphic) + extracted algorithms from MIT-licensed libraries
   - Core from: cesium-drawer (polygon editing), cesium_dev_kit (3D algorithms)
   - Rationale: Fast delivery while maintaining full control and customizability

2. **Unified GIS Store**: Replaced separate `measure.ts` store with unified `gis.ts` (572 lines)
   - Manages both measurement and drawing features
   - Reduces code duplication (~700 lines saved)

3. **Superseded Old Implementation**: `implement-gis-measure-tools` archived on 2025-12-05
   - Old MeasureLayer.vue (634 lines) → MeasureTool class in unified architecture
   - Reason: Avoid duplicate architecture, improve extensibility

### Performance Optimization (2025-12-04)
**Problem**: Dynamic preview was stuttering during mouse movement (< 30fps)

**Root Cause**: Frequent entity creation/destruction on every mouse move
- Before: ~60 times/sec × 3 entities = 180 create/destroy operations per second
- High GC pressure and rendering overhead

**Solution Implemented** (Commit: 83eda0b):

1. **CallbackProperty for Dynamic Updates**
   ```typescript
   // Before: Static properties, recreate entity every frame
   positions: [lastCartesian, this.drawCursorPosition]

   // After: Dynamic callback, entity created only once
   positions: new Cesium.CallbackProperty(() => {
     return this.drawCursorPosition ? [lastCartesian, this.drawCursorPosition] : []
   }, false)
   ```

2. **Smart Preview Rebuild Strategy**
   - Only recreate preview entities when vertex count changes
   - Mouse moves: 0 entity operations (CallbackProperty handles it)
   - Click to add vertex: Rebuild preview as needed

3. **Throttle Optimization**
   - Increased from 16ms (60fps) → 50ms (~20fps)
   - Rationale: 20fps sufficient for preview, reduces CPU load

**Performance Gains**:
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Entity create/destroy | ~180/sec | 0/sec | ∞ |
| Expected FPS | 20-30fps | 60fps | 2-3x |
| GC Pressure | High | Low | - |

**Documentation**: Created `docs/GIS_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md` with detailed technical writeup

### 3D Type System Design
- Introduced `Coordinate3D` interface with height modes: `clampToGround`, `relativeToGround`, `absolute`
- All Graphic classes support 3D coordinates (foundation for Phase 2+ 3D features)

### Feature Selection Implementation (2025-12-05)
**Phase 8 completed** - Map-based feature selection with visual highlighting

**Implementation**:
1. **scene.pick() for Map Selection**
   - Added `ScreenSpaceEventHandler` in GISLayer.vue
   - Entity lookup via `featureId` property binding
   - Skip selection when drawing tool is active

2. **Feature ID Binding**
   - Added `bindFeatureId()` method to BaseGraphic
   - Stores featureId on all entities via `PropertyBag`
   - Called after graphic creation in GISLayer.vue

3. **Visual Highlighting**
   - Added `setHighlight()` method to BaseGraphic
   - Saves original style before applying highlight (gold border, increased opacity)
   - Each Graphic subclass implements `applyStyle()` for live updates
   - Watch on `selectedFeatureIds` ensures highlight sync from all sources (map/list)

4. **Ctrl+Click Multi-selection**
   - Keyboard event listeners track Ctrl/Meta key state
   - Ctrl+Click: Toggle selection (`toggleSelection()`)
   - Normal click: Single selection (clear others)
   - Click empty space: Deselect all (unless Ctrl held)

### Feature Movement Implementation (2025-12-05)
**Phase 10 completed** - Drag-to-move for all feature types

**Implementation**:
1. **BaseGraphic Abstract Methods**
   - Added `move(offset: Cartesian3)` abstract method
   - Added `getPositions()` abstract method
   - All Graphic subclasses implement both methods

2. **Graphic Movement Logic**
   - PointGraphic: Single position update via `updatePosition()`
   - LineGraphic: All vertices offset via `updatePositions()`
   - PolygonGraphic: All vertices offset via `updatePositions()`
   - CircleGraphic: Center moved, radius preserved (recreates entity)
   - RectangleGraphic: Both corners offset (recreates entity)

3. **Drag Interaction in GISLayer.vue**
   - LEFT_DOWN: Start drag on selected feature, disable camera controls
   - MOUSE_MOVE: Calculate offset, move all selected features
   - LEFT_UP: Re-enable camera, sync geometry to store
   - `updateFeatureGeometry()` converts positions back to GeoJSON

4. **Multi-Feature Drag**
   - All selected features move together
   - Offset calculated incrementally (from last position)

### Vertex Editing Implementation (2025-12-05)
**Phase 11 completed** - Vertex editing for polygon and line features

**Implementation**:
1. **Double-Click to Enter Edit Mode**
   - LEFT_DOUBLE_CLICK handler in GISLayer.vue
   - Only polygon and line types support vertex editing
   - Calls `graphic.startEdit()` to show vertex markers

2. **Vertex Markers with Index Property**
   - All Graphic classes store `vertexIndex` in marker properties
   - PolygonGraphic: Red point markers at each vertex
   - LineGraphic: Point markers with custom style
   - RectangleGraphic: Markers at 4 corners
   - CircleGraphic: Center and edge markers

3. **Vertex Dragging**
   - `getVertexIndexFromEntity()` extracts index from picked entity
   - LEFT_DOWN detects vertex marker clicks
   - MOUSE_MOVE updates vertex position in real-time
   - LEFT_UP commits change and syncs geometry to store

4. **Delete Vertex (Shift+Click)**
   - Polygon: Minimum 3 vertices enforced
   - Line: Minimum 2 vertices enforced
   - Vertex markers refresh after deletion

5. **Exit Edit Mode**
   - ESC key: Calls `exitEditMode()`
   - Click empty space: Exits edit mode
   - Geometry synced to store on exit

**Code Changes**:
- GISLayer.vue: +200 lines for vertex editing handlers
- Fixed `isEditing` property/method conflict in all Graphic classes
- Fixed `isCreated` non-existent property references

### Style Configuration Panel Implementation (2025-12-05)
**Phase 12 completed** - Style configuration panel for selected features

**Implementation**:
1. **StylePanel Component**
   - Integrated into LayerControl features tab
   - Shows when 1+ features are selected
   - Auto-loads style from first selected feature

2. **Color Pickers**
   - Fill color picker (native color input)
   - Stroke color picker
   - Hex value display

3. **Sliders**
   - Fill opacity (0-100%)
   - Stroke width (1-10px)
   - Point size (5-30px, for point features only)

4. **Style Presets**
   - 6 predefined color schemes (cyan, red, green, orange, purple, blue)
   - One-click apply to selected features

5. **Real-time Application**
   - Changes apply immediately via `graphic.updateStyle()`
   - Multi-feature selection supported

**Code Changes**:
- LayerControl.vue: +355 lines for style panel

### GeoJSON Import/Export Implementation (2025-12-05)
**Phase 14 completed** - Full GeoJSON import/export support

**Implementation**:
1. **Export Function**
   - `featureToGeoJSONGeometry()` converts all feature types to GeoJSON
   - Point → GeoJSON Point
   - Line → GeoJSON LineString
   - Polygon → GeoJSON Polygon (with closing point)
   - Circle → GeoJSON Point + radius in properties
   - Rectangle → GeoJSON Polygon (4 corners)
   - Exports metadata: feature type, style, measurements

2. **Import Function**
   - `importGeoJSON()` parses GeoJSON string
   - `geoJSONToFeature()` converts GeoJSON to internal Feature
   - Supports FeatureCollection and single Feature
   - Auto-detects circle (has radius property)
   - Auto-detects rectangle (4 vertices + width/height)

3. **UI Integration**
   - Import button with file input
   - Export button (exports selected when features selected)
   - Error handling with user feedback

**Code Changes**:
- gis.ts: +180 lines for import/export logic
- LayerControl.vue: +60 lines for import UI

### Properties Panel Implementation (2025-12-05)
**Phase 13 completed** - Feature properties viewing and editing

**Implementation**:
1. **Editable Fields**
   - Name input field
   - Description textarea
   - Real-time save via `updateFeature()`

2. **Read-only Metadata**
   - Feature type (with Chinese labels)
   - Creation time (localized format)

3. **Geometry Properties**
   - Line: length, vertex count
   - Polygon: area, perimeter, vertex count
   - Circle: radius, area
   - Rectangle: dimensions, area
   - Distance: measured distance

**Code Changes**:
- LayerControl.vue: +260 lines for properties panel

## Open Questions

### 1. Next Phase Priority?
**Status**: Phase 10-12 (editing + styling) completed! ✅

**Remaining Options**:
- **Option A**: Phase 2-6 - Enhance Drawing Tools
  - Add real-time measurements, style config per tool
  - Pros: Complete feature parity for drawing
  - Estimated: 3-4 days

- **Option B**: Phase 13 - Properties Panel
  - Add name/description editing, custom fields
  - Pros: Better feature organization
  - Estimated: 1-2 days

- **Option C**: Phase 14 - GeoJSON Import/Export
  - Enable data exchange with other GIS tools
  - Pros: Practical for real-world workflows
  - Estimated: 1-2 days

**Recommendation**: Phase 14 (GeoJSON) for practical data workflows

### 2. Remaining Type Errors?
- Status: 63 TypeScript errors in test files (non-blocking)
- Question: Fix now or defer until after main features?
- Impact: Tests excluded from build, doesn't affect runtime

### 3. 3D Height Mode Default?
- Question: Should default be `clampToGround` or `relativeToGround`?
- Context: Water conservancy projects often need terrain-relative heights
- Current: Using `clampToGround` (ground level)

### 4. Testing Coverage Target?
- Current: LineGraphic 100%, PolygonGraphic 13%, others basic
- Question: Aim for 80% coverage before Phase 7, or defer?

### 5. Performance with 500+ Features?
- Question: Should we implement virtual scrolling for feature list now or wait until needed?
- Current design: Works well with <100 features
