  - `computeCentroidOfPolygon()` - Calculate polygon centroid for label positioning
  - `computeCutVolume()` - Core volume calculation algorithm using triangle mesh

## Algorithm Description

The volume calculation algorithm works by:
1. Subdividing the polygon into a dense triangle mesh using `Cesium.PolygonGeometry`
2. Sampling terrain elevation at each triangle vertex using `viewer.scene.globe.getHeight()`
3. Computing the volume of each triangular prism: `V = (base_area × (h1 + h2 + h3)) / 3`
4. Summing all prism volumes to get total cut/fill volume

This is particularly useful for water conservancy projects to calculate:
- Reservoir capacity
- Earthwork volume (cut and fill)
- Flood inundation volume

## Purpose
These algorithms provide accurate 3D volume calculation capabilities for the GIS toolkit, enabling water conservancy engineers to perform terrain analysis and capacity calculations.
